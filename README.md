# homework-3

For this homework, I started with pseudo code to break down the steps needed for a password generator. I then made a basic header and button. I created prompts for the user to enter the given values needed to generate a password, then called upon each individual function so their inputs would be factored into the output. I created a function that condition a series of if conditional loops that would take into account these inputs. Finally, I created a for loop that would combine all these factors, thus generating a password.
